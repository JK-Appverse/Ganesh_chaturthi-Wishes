# **App Name**: Ganesh Wishes Generator

## Core Features:

- Name Input: Allow the user to input their name.
- Image Generation: Generate an image with 'Happy Ganesh Chaturthi' written in Hindi, an image of Lord Ganesha at the top, and 'Happy Ganesh Chaturthi from [user's name]' at the bottom of the image. This feature will use a tool to decide how to render the various components in relation to each other, as well as how to automatically determine suitable line breaks, and a suitable color scheme for legibility.
- Image Display: Display the generated image to the user, with an option to download the image.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Gold (#D4AF37) to represent the divinity and richness of Ganesh Chaturthi.
- Background color: Light cream (#F5F5DC) to provide a soft and elegant backdrop.
- Accent color: Deep saffron (#FF9933) to add a traditional and festive touch.
- Font: 'Alegreya', a serif font. It will be used for both headings and body text to give the app a readable and elegant aesthetic.
- Use simple, elegant icons related to Ganesh Chaturthi, such as a Ganesha idol, a modak, or a kalash.
- Clean and centered layout to focus on the generated image. Use margins and padding to give content room to breathe.
- Subtle animations, such as a fade-in effect when the image is generated, to add a touch of dynamism.
